1. My attempts to solve some problems from the book by Hirsch and Hodkinson 'Relation algebras and games', for example [Problem 19.17](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/fileadmin/UCL-CS/staff/Robin_Hirsch/Papers/problems_status2.pdf).
2. I'm going to track here my progress on some tasks about modal logics related to products and filtration as well.
